                <h4>Team Meeting Etiquette & Frequency</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>We agree to be available Tuesday and Thursday between 11am and 1pm
                        for working together in person on sprints.</li>
                    <li>We are to be present and active at meetings.</li>
                    <li>If something comes up and we can no longer attend a team meeting (or will be late past 5
                        minutes), give the team know ahead of time.</li>
                    <li>We agree to check discord a minimum of once a day Monday through Friday.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Team Guidelines</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>We agree to work hard and aim for a high grade.</li>
                    <li>We agree to work ahead and avoid procrastination to the best of our ability.</li>
                    <li>We agree that functionality is more important than making things gorgeous.</li>
                    <li>We agree to work with safe and dependable methods while allowing ourselves some minor
                        exploration to try new techniques</li>
                    <li>We encourage each other to admit mistakes, since we're all here to learn.</li>
                    <li>There is to be no berating, put downs, or blaming/pointing fingers. Instead of dwelling on the
                        mistake, we'll work together to fix and solve mistakes.</li>
                    <li>We'll note what went wrong and what we did to fix the issue so that we can avoid making the same
                        mistake again.</li>
                    <li>Resolving Team Conflict
                        <ol>
                            <li>When a conflict occurs during our team, we will message via Discord for minor conflicts
                                and in person for bigger conflicts.</li>
                            <li>If things escalate beyond a point where we're able to resolve it or is not resolved
                                within a message, we will hop on a virtual call. Beyond that call, if it persists,
                                request Tyler for mediation/help/advice.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                            <li>Open up a PR, no matter how small the change appears.

                                    <li>In the Description, add in screenshots of what you see (or even a small mov/gif
                                        about the behavior).</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Have at least one approval from someone else before merging.</li>
                            <li>You can merge in another person’s PR as long as there’s another pair of eyes - make sure
                                to give a shoutout in Discord.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <li>
                        cPanel
                        <ol>
                            <li>We do not touch any code in the repository or public_html folders in cPanel (it doesn’t
                                matter if it’s adding or deleting or even one small character change, since this will
                                break our automatic deployment script).</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Front End Styling
                        <ol>
                            <li>When working on a feature that requires front end styling, discuss with the team to
                                decide on a standard.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Coding Standards
                        <ol>
                            <li>Each tab should be 4 spaces.</li>
                            <li>When copying and pasting code, make sure everything works as expected and clean up old
                                code/comments that are not appropriate.</li>
                            <li>When writing CSS, making sure to target a class or id (rather than a global element) to
                                prevent changing someone else's styles. If needed, search through the project for what
                                you're using to make sure you're not impacting another elements style.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
